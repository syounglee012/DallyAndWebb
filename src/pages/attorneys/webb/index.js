          <p>
            When I first opened my law practice, the only area of law that I
            didn’t want to practice was family law. However, over my first few
            years I discovered two things: One, I was very good at family law;
            and two, I enjoyed being able to help people as they worked through
            some of the most important parts of their lives. I view it as part
            of my mission to help clients and their children suffer as little
            pain and trauma as possible through divorce and child custody
            battles. I take great pride in going the extra mile to achieve a
            client’s objectives. Being passionate about my profession, I have
            been Board Certified in Family Law since 2011, and I am a member of
            several statewide family law boards. Additionally, in 2021 I was
            admitted as a Fellow of the prestigious American Academy of
            Matrimonial Lawyers that is comprised of only nationwide experts in
            family law.
            <br />
            <br /> I grew up in Crowley, Texas and have lived in the Fort Worth
            area for nearly my entire life. I attended Abilene Christian
            University, and upon graduation, attended Texas Wesleyan University
            School of Law (now Texas A&M University School of Law). My wife and
            I are both very active in the Fort Worth community. We have two
            children and are both involved in their school, Southwest Christian.
