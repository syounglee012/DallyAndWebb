          <p>
            As a legal assistant during law school, I was exposed to family law
            and immediately knew that’s the type of law I wanted to practice.
            Family Law gives me the ability to connect with people on a personal
            level, help solve problems and lead people through one of the
            toughest struggles of their lives. Whether it’s in the courtroom or
            in the office, I enjoy being able to effectively and zealously
            advocate for my clients and to change their lives for the better.
            <br />
            <br /> I grew up in Coppell, Texas and attended Ursuline Academy in
            Dallas. I am a graduate Texas Christian University and Texas
            Wesleyan School of Law (now Texas A&M School of Law). My husband and
            I are avid TCU fans and never miss a game. When we are not cheering
            on the Horned Frogs, you can usually find me spending quality time
            with my husband, three daughters, two dogs and one cat.
